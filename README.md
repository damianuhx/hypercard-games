In order to play or edit these games you need <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard</a> which is only available on MacOS classic. 
There are apps that claim to run HyperCard stacks on other operating systems but I didn't succeed in making them work on my machine. 
You can also use an emulator to run HyperCard on modern machines.
